# 0x02. i18n

This project focuses on implementing internationalization (i18n) in a Flask application to support multiple languages and localize timestamps. You'll learn how to parametrize Flask templates to display different languages, infer the correct locale, and localize timestamps.

## Resources

Read or watch:

- [Flask-Babel](https://pythonhosted.org/Flask-Babel/)
- [Flask i18n tutorial](https://www.patricksoftwareblog.com/internationalization-and-localization-in-flask/)
- [pytz](https://pytz.sourceforge.net/)

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you will be able to:

- Parametrize Flask templates to display content in different languages.
- Infer the correct locale based on URL parameters, user settings, or request headers.
- Localize timestamps according to different time zones.

## Requirements

- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.7).
- All your files should end with a new line.
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory.
- Your code should use the pycodestyle style (version 2.5).
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/env python3`.
- All your `*.py` files should be executable.
- All your modules should have documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`).
- All your classes should have documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)'`).
- All your functions and methods should have documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'` and `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)'`).
- Documentation should be a real sentence explaining the purpose of the module, class, or method.
- All your functions and coroutines must be type-annotated.
